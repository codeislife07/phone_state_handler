## DESCRIPTION

This plugin allows you to know quickly and easily if your Android or iOS device is receiving a call and to know the status of the call.

- Native Android: [TelephonyManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager)
- Native iOS: [CallKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit)

## PAY ATTENTION

- In the iOS simulator doesn't work
- The phone number is only obtainable on Android!

## HOW TO INSTALL
#### Flutter
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  phone_state: 1.0.4
```
#### Android: Added permission on manifest
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG" />
```
> **Warning**: Adding `READ_CALL_LOG` permission, your app will be removed from the Play Store if you don't have a valid reason to use it. [Read more](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9047303?hl=en). But if you don't add it, you will not be able to know caller's number.
